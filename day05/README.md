# Hangman Game- Drosophila Theme

Welcome to the Hangman game! In the game the user needs to guess a word from the word bank, all Fly and neuronal remodeling themed.
The program will let the user know that they have 6 mistakes to make- before the man is hung. It will also show the player blank underscores for unguessed letters.
If the player guesses correctly, they will have another turn and the blank work will get updated accordingly, however, if they make a mistake, another line in the hangman drawing will be added. 
The program lets the user know if they already guessed a letter, and lets them guess  again.
