    "summary": "Enables several functions, including heparin binding activity; protein dimerization activity; and signaling receptor binding activity. Involved in several processes, including embryonic morphogenesis; open tracheal system development; and regionalization. Acts upstream of with a positive effect on imaginal disc fusion, thorax closure. Located in cell leading edge; dense core granule lumen; and extracellular space. Colocalizes with cytoneme. Is expressed in several structures, including anterior-posterior subdivision of organism; compartment boundary; epithelium; imaginal disc; and wing vein. Used to study juvenile polyposis syndrome. Human ortholog(s) of this gene implicated in several diseases, including CAKUT (multiple); bone disease (multiple); cleft lip; hemochromatosis type 1; and orofacial cleft 11. Orthologous to human BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2) and BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4). [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Jul 2025]",
