**Progress Report Tool**

- **Description:**: A small CLI utility to parse `subjects.txt`, list open/closed assignments, produce a submission-completeness report (Day01–Day08 + final project proposal), and export a color-coded Excel workbook showing per-student submissions and timeliness.

**Files**
- **`subjects.txt`**: Input data file (tab-separated-ish) containing rows with: serial, status (OPEN/CLOSED), assignment title, submission ISO timestamp.
- **`progress_report.py`**: Main script. Contains functions to parse, filter, analyze completeness, and export an Excel workbook (`.xlsx`).
- **`report.xlsx`**: Example output file generated by the script when using `--export report.xlsx`.

**Requirements**
- **Python:**: Python 3.8+
- **Python package:**: `openpyxl` (used only for `--export`)

Install dependency (recommended for the current user):
```bash
pip3 install --user openpyxl
```

**How it works (brief)**
- `load_subjects()` parses `subjects.txt` into records.
- The script treats the first column as serial, second as status, third as assignment text, and fourth as submission timestamp.
- Assignment parsing heuristics try to extract the student name (looks for "by ..." or `-`) and which day(s) are present in the title (e.g., "Day05", "day 05", or "Day 05 and 06").
- Day07 is ignored (there was no assignment on that day).
- A full submission is considered: submitted Days 01,02,03,04,05,06,08 and a final project proposal.
- Deadlines (used to classify on-time vs late):
  - Day01: `2025.11.01 22:00`
  - Day02: `2025.11.09 22:00`
  - Day03: `2025.11.16 22:00`
  - Day04: `2025.11.23 22:00`
  - Day05: `2025.11.29 22:00`
  - Day06: `2025.12.06 22:00`
  - Day08: `2025.12.30 22:00`
  - Project proposal: `2026.01.11 22:00`

 - Coloring conventions (cell font color):
    - **Red**: Not submitted (missing)
    - **Yellow**: Submitted after the deadline (late)
    - **Black**: Submitted on time

**Usage**
- Print human-readable lists of closed/open assignments:
```bash
python3 progress_report.py
```

- Print JSON (open/closed only):
```bash
python3 progress_report.py --json
```

- Print the "missing submissions" report (per-student completeness, ignoring Day07):
```bash
python3 progress_report.py --report
```

- Export the Excel workbook (two sheets) with color-coding; optional filename after `--export` (default `report.xlsx`):
```bash
python3 progress_report.py --export report.xlsx
```

- Use a different `subjects.txt` file:
```bash
python3 progress_report.py --file path/to/subjects.txt --export my_report.xlsx
```
