**AI tools used:** co-pilot, claude sonnet 3.5

## Function use:
In our lab, we work with Drosophila Melanogaster, that have a relatively short life cycle. Therefore, when we collect offspring from a cross, we need to make sure
that this cross was set up less than 18 days ago, otherwise we could already have F2 progeny, which we cannot always cotrol for in terms of
desired genotypes. This calculation happens on a daily basis in our lab.

## Prompts that I used:
1. can you open a new file under the name "LastDateForCollection.py" under the folder "day02"
2. Can you generate in this file a function that asks the user to input a date and outputs the date that is 18 days before the input date, according to the christian calendar?
3. can you generate a new GUI file for this function?
4. so can you generate the same function with only a command line? no input?
